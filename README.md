## üìä Project Overview
A comprehensive emergency room analytics dashboard built to track and analyze patient visits, satisfaction metrics, and demographic patterns. This project transforms raw healthcare data into actionable insights, helping hospital administrators make informed decisions about resource allocation and patient care.

## üéØ Key Metrics Analyzed

### Patient Volume & Distribution
- Total Visits: 9,216 patients
- Administrative vs Non-Administrative: Nearly even split (50.04% vs 49.96%)
- Weekday/Weekend Distribution: 6.6K weekday visits vs 2.6K weekend visits
- Year-over-Year Growth: 12.7% increase from 4,338 (2019) to 4,878 (2020)

### Patient Demographics
- Age Group Distribution:
  * Seniors lead with 3.3K visits
  * Adults & Middle Age: 1.9K & 1.8K respectively
  * Pediatric cases (combined): 1.4K
- Gender Distribution:
  * Male: 51.1%
  * Female: 48.7%
  * Undisclosed: 0.3%

### Department Performance
- Average Satisfaction Score: 5.47/10
- Service Rating Coverage: 72.69% rated
- Average Wait Time: 35.26 minutes
- Patient Flow:
  * Walk-In: 58.6%
  * Referred: 41.4%

## üìà Key Insights

### Department Referral Patterns
1. General Practice leads specialized referrals (1.8K)
2. Orthopedics shows significant volume (1.0K)
3. Specialized departments (Cardiology, Neurology) maintain consistent traffic
